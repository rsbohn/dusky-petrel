Reached a milestone: the emulator now supports slow-memory reads for pacing, a TC08 tape image
backend, and both host-side monitor commands and Nova I/O wiring for tape operations. The monitor
gained `tc` status plus `tc0`/`tc1` attach/read/write/verify commands, and the Nova side can move
129-word blocks to and from memory. The dullboy sample now uses slow-memory reads to delay output,
and round-trip tape transfers were verified end-to-end.
