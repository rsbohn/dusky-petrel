Worked through the watchdog timer implementation and monitor support. Added a new Nova watchdog
device with timeout/control/status registers, NIO start/clear/pulse, and skip semantics, then wired
it into the emulator and monitor. The monitor now supports `wdt` commands for host control, status,
timeouts, repeat mode, and action selection, and the assembler prints an MD5 fingerprint of the
assembled source.

While testing with `sd/dullboy.asm`, the BUSY delay subroutine needed several fixes: avoid `JMP`
(unsupported), return via a saved AC3 and indirect branch, avoid clearing AC3 while clearing LINK,
and replace the `ADDI` countdown (LINK carry interference) with a `SUB` against a constant.
Conditional-branch target computation and disassembly were corrected so `BZ/BNZ` use direct
addresses and display properly. The CPU now tracks halt reasons (HALT instruction, unknown opcode,
watchdog, or break) and the monitor reports them in both step output and run summaries. Ctrl-C now
halts the guest instead of terminating the host.
